TO RUN THE INDEX LOCALLY :

Add a package.json file to the project folder

Then copy/paste the following text:

{
   "name": "Demo",
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "description": "demo project.",
   "scripts": {
     "lite": "lite-server --port 10001",
     "start": "npm run lite"
   },
   "author": "",
   "license": "ISC",
   "devDependencies": {
     "lite-server": "^1.3.1"
   }
}
4. Install the web server

In a terminal window (command prompt in Windows) opened on your project folder, run this command:

npm install
This will install lite-server (defined in package.json), a static server that loads index.html in your default browser and auto refreshes it when application files change.

5. Start the local web server!

(Assuming you have an index.html file in your project folder).

In the same terminal window (command prompt in Windows) run this command:

npm start
